 I have created the tabbed pane. I thought that we could use two panels, one for making alarms, and one for viewing/editing them.
 
 The addAlarm must take input from user and return output, maybe an object? The data will be fed to a CSV file IN ORDER, and when
 	the program opens up it will read the CSV file, since the data is IN ORDER we can re-create those alarms. That being said,
 	the alarm trigger must check the values and be able to trigger even if we set the alarm for 2:00, we turn the app on at 5:00 and the
 	alarm triggers right away. Not sure exactly how we want to tackle that.
